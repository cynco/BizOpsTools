## Running webapp from Python Anywhere

The file structure is the same. The files have to be imported into the pythonanywhere.com directory for the webapp. 

Webapp has to be re-launched after any changes to the code (from the pythonanywhere webapp dashboard). 

The webapp is available at: http://resy.pythonanywhere.com/
